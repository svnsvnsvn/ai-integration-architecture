This document describes the architecture of our secure document processing system.

2. COMPONENTS
- Web Interface: FastAPI-based REST API
- Processing Engine: LangGraph workflow orchestration
- Storage: SQLite database with encrypted fields
- Security: Rate limiting, input validation, audit logging

3. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
- All inputs are validated and sanitized
- Sensitive data is encrypted before storage
- Access logs are maintained for audit purposes
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

4. DEPLOYMENT
- Container-based deployment using Docker
- Environment variables for configuration
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

5. MONITORING
- Application performance monitoring
- Security event logging
- Error tracking and alerting
